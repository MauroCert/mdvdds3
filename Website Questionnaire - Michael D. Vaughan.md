**Destination Nashville**

We want to develop a Web Page called Destination Nashville. The concept is:  Combine your dental care with a vacation in Nashville.  Specifically,  I want to attract patients with  PTSD, Trauma, Dental Anxiety, Disabilities to fly to Nashville and patients with a Special Needs child to receive care with  us. Ideally they would  have two dental  appointments at our office: one appointment for consultation to determine their dental needs (45 minutes) and one appointment to address their dental concerns using oral and iv sedation (90-120 minutes)  They can be asleep for their dental appointment, receive the dental care they want and have little to no memory of the  experience, just great memories of their vacation in Nashville. 

I want to introduce you to Carol Andrews at Andrews Travel.  She is a native Nashvillian and can tailor their vacation flight and accommodations to their desires and budget. Cristina, can you email Carol a link to upload her photographs and paragraph about her. I want her profile picture to go on this page. Please design the page as you develop our new website.
